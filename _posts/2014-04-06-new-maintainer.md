Hello, I am Nate Craun, the new maintainer of Scan Tailor. I am a big fan of Scan Tailor, and I use it all the time, that's why I was saddened to hear that it is no longer being maintained. I'm a really big believer in this project, and I don't want to see it die like so many other unmaintained projects. I am very interested in document image processing, and have done some work in this area before with the article [A Linux Guide to Bookscanning](https://natecraun.net/articles/linux-guide-to-book-scanning.html) using Scan Tailor for the document image cleanup, and my free software [smoothscan](https://natecraun.net/projects/smoothscan/) project.

I plan on merging features from the extended, featured, and plus branches into the master branch so that we can have a unified Scan Tailor. I also will be reaching out to packagers from many Linux distributions to do what I can to get Scan Tailor added to their software repositories, as well as supporing the packagers who already include Scan Tailor in their distros. I also want to increase Scan Tailor's profile, and see if we can spark up some fresh developer interest. Of course, I will also respond to bug reports and feature requests.

So far I have completed setting up a new website, irc channel, mailing lists, and migrated the code to Github. I am still working on getting the bug reports and feature requests moved from the old Sourceforge site into the Github issue tracker. Once all the infrastructure and administration tasks are out of the way, the real work can begin.
