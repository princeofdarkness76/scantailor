## Mailing Lists

The old mailing lists have been migrated from Sourceforge to Google Groups. You only need a Google account to reply via the web interface. If you post via email you can use whatever email you want. In order to cut down on spam, you must join the group before posting. However, anyone and everyone is allowed to join.

[scantailor-devel](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/scantailor-devel) is for developers about the maintenance and expansion Scan Tailor.

[scantailor-users](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/scantailor-users) is for user support and general questions.

## IRC Channel

Scan Tailor has the open channel [\#scantailor](irc://irc.freenode.net/scantailor) on Freenode for general discussion about Scan Tailor. You can connect via the [Freenode web client](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=scantailor) if you do not have a standalone IRC client.

## Forums

Scan Tailor has a section on the [DIYBookscanner forums](http://www.diybookscanner.org/forum/viewforum.php?f=21). There are a lot of Scan Tailor users and fans on the DIYBookscanner site, and they are generally a friendly group.
